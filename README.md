## Clean-Up & Simple Run

Clean up the files from the example repository and do not forget to install the dependencies
There is a good example by default on `HomeScreen`. You can delete the all screens.

- `yarn`
- `yarn clean-up`
- `yarn && yarn pod-install`
- `react-native run-ios/android`

**OR**

- `rm -rf .git README.md`
- `rm -rf ./assets`
- `yarn`
- `yarn husky:setup`
- `npx pod-install` (iOS Only)
- `react-native run-ios/android`

## Husky Integration

Before doing anything else, please simply run the command to initalize the husky. If you do not run clean-up part you should run the husky setup by yourself

```jsx
npm run husky:setup
```

`husky:setup` will handle the initialization, installation and ready to use `commitlint`, `prettier` and `eslint`.

## Rename the project: (Thanks to [react-native-name](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename))

```sh
npx react-native-rename <your-project-name>
```

> With custom Bundle Identifier (Android only. For iOS, please use Xcode)

```sj
npx react-native-rename <your-project-name> -b <bundleIdentifier>
```

### Install Pods (iOS Only)

- `npm i`
- `cd ios && pod install`
- `cd .. && react-native run-ios/android`

### Android local.properties (Android Only)

- `npm i`
- `cd android && mkdir local.properties`
- `nano local.properties`

#### Example of MacOS Android SDK Path

Make sure that set your right path of Android **SDK**

##### MacOS / Linux

Replace your machine name instead of `username`

```
sdk.dir=/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk
```

##### Windows

Replace your machine name instead of `username`

```
sdk.dir=/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk
```
